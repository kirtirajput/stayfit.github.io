<ul>
<li><b>LEARN</b></li>
</ul>
<p><dd><i>The more you know, the better your results. Never stop learning. 
Thanks to the digital age, it's now easier than ever to find 
information on training and nutrition. So you can learn more and more 
and apply yourself to get better results, which inturn motivate you to give your best shot.
</i></dd></p>
<ul>
<li><b>TEACH</b></li>
</ul>
<p><dd><i>Few things are as gratifying as knowing that some tip or 
piece of advice—whether it pertains to rep ranges, food choices,
 or something as simple as a change of grip on an exercise—helped 
 someone advance toward their goal. That sense of pride and satisfaction
 from helping a fellow iron warrior can be a big motivator to get you to
 the gym and crush it.
 </i>
 </dd>
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>ADMIRE</b></li>
</ul>
<p><dd><i>Most of us, are happy with the way we currently look. No matter h
ow lean and muscular any of us are, we're always trying to improve upon it. 
Some call that body dysmorphia. I call it dedication.
Don't let the admiration of others people's physiques backfire and
make you feel worse about yourself. We all travel different paths, and we
all have different genetics and body types.
</i>
</dd>
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>LISTEN</b></li>
</ul>
<p><dd><i>Listen, not to me—to your favorite music! Having good music 
that you look forward to can help you stay motivated and get to the gym. 
Once at the gym, that music can help you have a better workout.
Research confirms this! A study I presented at the National Strength and 
Conditioning Association, using recreational bodybuilders as my subjects,
 highlighted that those who were able to listen to their preferred playlist
 completed an average of 1 rep more per set. This may not sound like much, 
 but 11 reps to failure on the same exercise using the same weight as a 
 set of 10 reps is 10 percent more work performed.
 </i>
 </dd>
 </p>
<ul>
<li><b>CHECK</b></li>
</ul>
<p><dd><i>Often in life, the things that disappoint us, upset us, and depress 
us are silly things that add up and make us want to give in and give up. 
The stresses of life can derail the fitness plan that was supposed to help 
derail the stress to begin with. Sounds ridiculous, right? Sometimes we just
 need to get over ourselves. There are plenty of people struggling with 
 much bigger problems, so try to put yours into perspective.
